#
# External actions
# ----------------
#
# Every section starts with a line containing the "%action <name>",
# "%pre-send <name>", "%pre-receive <name>" or "%manual <name>" text.
# Please note that the <name> of any kind is necessary. It mustn't be
# empty. Inside it the following parameters can be used:
#
# event
# -----
# Can be "msg", "sms", "url", "online", "offline", "auth",
# "contacts" or "notification".
#
# The latter means CenterIM's own notifications, such as birthday reminders,
# away messages, and other stuff. Specifying several event types is
# also allowed. "all" stands for all the event types.
#
# proto
# -----
# Can be "icq", "yahoo", "aim", "irc", "msn", "lj", "rss" or "jab". Or
# combination of these words. "all" can be used as a synonym for all of
# them.
#
# status
# ------
# Can be "online", "away", "dnd", "na", "occupied", "ffc" or "invisible".
# Specifying several ones is possible. "all" stands for all of possible
# status modes.
#
# options
# -------
# Possible options for an action are:
#
#       stdin           The incoming message text is to be passed to
#                       stdin of the script to be executed.
#
#       stdout          The script output is to be sent as a reply
#                       message (if not empty).
#
#       nowait          Don't wait for the script to finish. Obviously, the
#                       stdout option won't make sense if this one is used.
#
# Then, the section named "%exec" should follow. It contains a piece of
# script to be executed being copied to a file first.
